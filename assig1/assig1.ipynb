    "Patient: Yes doctor. I’m having a temperature and even a sore throat.\n",
    "Doctor: Let me check.\n",
    "Doctor: You have a moderate fever. Let me check your temperature.\n",
    "(Doctor uses a thermometer to check the temperature of a patient by snapping around one of the fingers)\n",
    "Patient: This thermometer is different from the last one you used.\n",

    "Patient: That’s really great.\n",
    "Doctor: Yes it is.\n",
    "(Now he removed the thermometer)\n",
    "Doctor: Temperature is not too high, around 99.8. Let me check your blood pressure as well.\n",

    "Patient: Not sweating, but I feel slightly cold when I sit under a fan.\n",
    "Doctor: Ok. You have few signs of malaria. I would recommend you undergo a blood test. Nothing to worry about. In most cases, the test comes out to be negative. It’s just careful, as there has been a spurt in malaria cases in the last month or so.\n",
    "Doctor: I am writing three medicines and syrup. The number of dots in front of each medicine name tells you how many times in the day you have to take them. For example, the two dots here mean you’ve to take the medicine twice in the day, once in the morning and once after dinner.\n",
    "Doctor: Do you have any other questions?\n",
    "Patient: No, doctor. Thank you.\n",
    "Doctor: So, what makes you come here?\n",

    "Doctor: What tests have you conducted?\n",
    "Attendant: On the recommendation of doctors in Delhi, we did blood tests, CT scan, and biopsy. We have taken three views on the reports and all have come up with opined colorectal cancer. Here are the reports.\n",
    "Doctor: Yes, this seems cancerous. We need to admit him today itself and get a few tests done. And let’s meet tomorrow morning when you have the reports of these tests.\n",
    "Attendant: OK. Thank you.\n",
    "(The doctor formulates his observations on his letterhead and gives it over to the Patient. The person then admits the patient and visits the doctor again the next morning with new reports in hand.)\n",
    "Doctor: The cancer is just one stage before it will expand to other parts. In this case, the best course of action is quick surgery to extract the affected part accompanied by radiation therapy.\n",
    "Attendant: How many days of treatment will be needed?\n",
    "Doctor: We can perform the operation in a couple of days. Consequently, we will keep the patient under observation for 4-5 days. Radiation therapy has become pretty regulated and therefore you can get it done in any tier-2 city, which will not only be useful to you but also decrease your cost.\n",
    "Attendant: And for how long the patient will have to go through radiation therapy?\n",
    "Doctor: The patient has to take one dose every two weeks for three months. You require to visit the hospital only on days you obtain therapy. Once radiation therapy is done, you should discuss an oncologist every three months in the beginning and every year later on to check for the remission of cancerous cells.\n",
    "Attendant: OK. I’ve heard radiation therapy has side effects.\n",
    "Doctor: Yes, radiation therapy has side effects. It can lead to hair loss, nausea, and loss of appetite.\n",
    "Attendant: Thank you, doctor. We will get him admitted today.\n",
